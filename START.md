## Pre-Requisites

For configuring Hive in your system you must have insatlled already java and Hadoop echosystem.

In this tutorial I am not going to cover the installation and configuration processs of bigdata framework.I am going to cover how to star hive and the hive query which in whole tutorial. I will show you some  examples also.

For working in Hive first condition is that namenode of hadoop framework  is already running. You can check status by using **jps** command on the terminal.

If you are getting status like above :point_up: shown image then you to start hadoop echo system. For starting hadoop you to go to the root directory of hadoop then go to the sbin directory.
Type the following command :point_down:

```
start-all.sh
```
After starting type **_jps_** command terminal which show the message like below given 
in the image :point_down:

![jpsstatus](https://github.com/maniram-yadav/Hive/blob/master/images/jps.png)
So namenode has been successfully started successfully.

##### Starting Hive

After above step type the following command to start the Hive :point_down:
```

Following message will appear on the terminal :point_down:
