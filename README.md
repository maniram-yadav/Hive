##### What is Hive ?

  Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure tool to process structured data in Hadoop. 
  It resides on top of Hadoop to summarize Big Data, and makes querying and analyzing easy.

Initially Hive was developed by Facebook, later the Apache Software Foundation took it 
up and developed it further as an open source under the name Apache Hive. It is used by
different companies. For example, Amazon uses it in Amazon Elastic MapReduce.

This is a brief tutorial that provides an introduction on how to use Apache Hive HiveQL
with Hadoop Distributed File System. This tutorial can be your first step towards becoming 
a successful Hadoop Developer with Hive.
